        <p class="AboutText">Ryan McCurdy is a professional developer that has been molded by the 
            corporate world of marketing and business operations. After spending a number of years working synchronously with people and computers,
            and a many more playing video games at his leisure, he decided it was time to understand how everything 
            worked "under the hood."
            <br>
            <br>
            A total tech nerd, his curiosity drives forward his innate desire to learn, build, and play. Away from the keyboard and controller, Ryan likes to spend his time in nature,
             exploring the parks in Greater Cleveland and beyond. 
             <br>
             <br>
            Whether behind a keyboard, drum kit, or mixing bowl, Ryan's incessant drive to constantly improve is as asset to any team he may be a part of.
            Whether fighting hordes of logic problems, or sailing the high seas of Google, compassion pushes
            him to make connections with his teammates, to better understand one another and aid in solving problems together!
