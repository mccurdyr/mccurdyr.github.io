      <p class="AboutText">
        Ryan McCurdy is a professional developer that has been molded by the
        corporate world of marketing and business operations. After spending a
        number of years working synchronously with people and computers, and a
        many more playing video games at his leisure, he decided it was time to
        understand how everything worked "under the hood."
        <br />
        <br />
        A total tech nerd, his curiosity drives forward his innate desire to
        learn, build, and play. Away from the keyboard and controller, Ryan
        likes to spend his time in nature, exploring the parks in Greater
        Cleveland and beyond.
        <br />
        <br />
        Whether behind a keyboard, drum kit, or mixing bowl, Ryan's incessant
        drive to constantly improve is as asset to any team he may be a part of.
        Whether fighting hordes of logic problems, or sailing the high seas of
        Google, compassion pushes him to make connections with his teammates, to
        better understand one another and aid in solving problems together!

          Seed & Feed is a modern garden planner and recipe finder built with the new gardener in mind.
          This was my final project for our coding bootcamp. The team and I tackled many challenges along 
          the way, but we're extremely proud of how it turned out! It is scalable, and we can see an opportunity
           to monotize. This app was a great demonstration of what software development empowers people to do as a team.

          This was my first time coding in a group setting, and I had an absolute blast with it! We were tasked with creating a webapp through which
          users could review a topic. Our group took a vote, and The Magic Rockets were off to the races! We used MVC patterns through Spring Boot and 
          Thymeleaf to collaborate on building this app. I think we did pretty well!

          This one was a test of my ability to use if/else statements in a
          creative and adaptable manner! It may not have been dangerous OR
          adventurous, but it solidified my understanding of conditional
          statements.

          This one was a bit of a doozy. I built a console game in which the
          player manages the needs of their Virtual Pets. This really
          established my solid understanding of classes, objects, and how
          they're able to interact with one another at a simple, yet versatile
          manner.
